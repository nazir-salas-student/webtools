        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <a href="images/blacksmithing.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img src="images/blacksmithing.jpg" alt="blacksmthing demo">
        </a>
        <p class="first">I'm using this to demonstrate how to write basic web code. I can change and add/remove what I
            need at any time. I also make sure that there is no other issues while making changes.</p>
        <p>My name is <strong>Nazir</strong> and I work in the semiconductor industry for three years now. But I also
            feel like there is no better time for a career change. I hope I can combine what I have learned here with my
            semiconductor experience for my next opportunity.</p>

        <p>I am taking this course to help fulfill requirements for the Bachelors in Applied Technology program. I hope
            that the BAT program will help me further develop my career.</p>
        <p>I am an avid blacksmith. It is something that I enjoy. The desire to make things from basic materials is
            really rewarding.</p>

        <p>You can say that it is a lot like programming. You take something, try to figure out a deisgn, start a
            process, fix things as you go and then finish the final product with a polish. It is likely a quality that
            makes programming interesting to me. I find that making a web page or a knife is extremely fulfilling. But
            in both cases, it will take more for me to make something really good for the public.</p>

        <h2>My Experience in HTML</h2>
        <p class="first">I have worked on HTML before in a different class.</p>
        <p>Committing and pushing changes is a new one for me. I hope to address any gaps I have.</p>
        <p>Some of the setup is a bit new to me but I hope to practice and get over the hurdle.</p>
        <p>I do have working knowledge of <em>Java</em>, <em>C++</em> and <em>Python</em>. I have used them to solvea
            variety of problems. One of my favorite projects was creating a program that had a graphical interface that
            looks at data from a SQL table and generates the information that the user selects for. This has quite a few
            applications. Some of them are projects that I am currently working for in my job.</p>
        <p>I find that designing a web site and designing a program are very different. There are different rules to
            follow. If I have to describe it, HTML requires more artistic choices than other programming languages do.
            Which I find challenging but it is a quality that I have to figure out. And who knows, maybe I might make
            something that people will like.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, there are a lot of common point. You have to solve a problem and design a way to remedy
            an issue that you encounter while programming. It is something that doesn't change between languages, and I
            expect that to be true for HTML as well.</p>

        <h2>My Avatar</h2>
        <p class="first">But enough of my story. Let's look at someone who is starting just like me.</p>
        <a href="images/dog.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img src="images/dog.jpg" alt="A good boy">
        </a>
        <p>His name is <strong>Ace</strong> and he is interested in programming. Hey, there are no rules against a dog
            learning how to program. So, why not give a dog an chance?</p>
        <p>Ace wanted to learn how to program. He didn't know what he wanted to do exactly, but he knew that he had to
            take the chance.
            Which is why when the opportunity presented itself, he took it. He studies from tutorial online, found
            problems that he wanted to solve.
            Finally, when he built a portfolio and applied to a team, he managed to get in.
        </p>
        <p>Much like me, Ace has to train in order to be the best at programming. But with practice and preseverence,
            even a dog can program like the pros. </p>
        <p>Much like the source of inspiration, there is a team backing Ace, who helps him prepare for the rigors of his
            day to day training.</p>
        <p>That is also true for you and me as well. Like with any job, there is a training proess that prepares the new
            hire for anything that they would encounter.</p>

        <p>
            Just because the job is there doesn't mean that a person or a dog stops learning. Once you are acclimated to
            the demands of the job,
            taking the time to

        <p class="first">Now let us talk about onboading! There is a start in for every new hire, and for you and me, it
            comes with training!</p>
        <p>For every new hire, there is a bootcamp that introduces new hires with the pipelines and tools that are a
            part
            of the employee's kit.</p>
        <p>When the bootcamp is completed, there is alwyas more opportunities to grow as a part of the company.
            There are also classes that are taught by subject matter experts which will help you gain new insights or
            even allow you to review what you know so that
