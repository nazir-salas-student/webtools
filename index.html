    <h1>Hello World! A Training Website</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="first">I'm using this to demonstrate how to write basic web code. I can change and add/remove what I
            need at any time. I also make sure that there is no other issues while making changes.</p>
        <p>My name is <strong>Nazir</strong> and I work in the semiconductor industry for three years now. But I also
            feel like there is no better time for a career change. I hope I can combine what I have learned here with my
            semiconductor experience for my next opportunity.</p>
        <p>I am taking this course to help fulfill requirements for the Bachelors in Applied Technology program. I hope
            that the BAT program will help me further develop my career.</p>
        <p>I am an avid blacksmith. It is something that I enjoy. The desire to make things from basic materials is
            really rewarding.</p>
        <p>You can say that it is a lot like programming. You take something, try to figure out a deisgn, start a
            process, fix things as you go and then finish the final product with a polish. It is likely a quality that
            makes programming interesting to me. I find that making a web page or a knife is extremely fulfilling. But
            in both cases, it will take more for me to make something really good for the public.</p>

        <h2>My Experience in HTML</h2>
        <p class="first">I have worked on HTML before in a different class.</p>
        <p>Committing and pushing changes is a new one for me. I hope to address any gaps I have.</p>
        <p>Some of the setup is a bit new to me but I hope to practice and get over the hurdle.</p>
        <p>I do have working knowledge of <em>Java</em>, <em>C++</em> and <em>Python</em>. I have used them to solvea
            variety of problems. One of my favorite projects was creating a program that had a graphical interface that
            looks at data from a SQL table and generates the information that the user selects for. This has quite a few
            applications. Some of them are projects that I am currently working for in my job.</p>
        <p>I find that designing a web site and designing a program are very different. There are different rules to
            follow. If I have to describe it, HTML requires more artistic choices than other programming languages do.
            Which I find challenging but it is a quality that I have to figure out. And who knows, maybe I might make
            something that people will like.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, there are a lot of common point. You have to solve a problem and design a way to remedy
            an issue that you encounter while programming. It is something that doesn't change between languages, and I
            expect that to be true for HTML as well.</p>

        <h2>My Avatar</h2>
        <p class="first">But enough of my story. Let's look at someone who is starting just like me.</p>
        <img src="/webtools/images/dog.jpg" alt="A good boy">
        <p>His name is <strong>Ace</strong> and he is interested in programming. Hey, there are no rules against a dog
            learning how to program. So, why not give a dog an chance?</p>
        <p>Much like me, Ace has to train in order to be the best at programming. But with practice and preseverence,
            even a dog can program like the pros. </p>
