<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm using this to demonstrate how to write basic web code. You must modify the content of your page for your specific needs.</p>
<p>My name is Nazir and I work in the semiconductor industry for three years now.</p>
<p>I am taking this course to help fulfill requirements for the Bachelors in Applied Technology program.</p>
<p>I hope that the BAT program will help me further develop my career.</p>
<h2>My Experience in HTML</h2>
<p>I have worked on HTML before in a different class.</p>
<p>Committing and pushing changes is a new one for me. I hope to address any gaps I have.</p>
<p>Some of the setup is a bit new to me but I hope to pratice and get over the hurdle.</p>
