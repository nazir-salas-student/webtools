My goal with this project is to complete the Orientation assignment for the Web Tools class at Dallas College. 

The goal of the assignment is to demonstrate an understanding of the worlflow and my ability to navigate Visual Studio Code and Git to create HtLM projects. 

The result should be a functional HTML Page.

New revision involved creating new pages and made some style/created links.
